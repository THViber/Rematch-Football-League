<h1>Welcome to RFL!</h1>
This is a solo project, made by Vibe, the owner and founder of Inferna and RFL. This is the official website for Rematch Football League. There is no AI, no copy/paste code, and no plans on bringing anyone else on to program this. Therefore, this will take time, and there will most likely be bugs. I ask that if you do find something off, have a suggestion, or find a bug, please DM thviberz on Discord, and make sure to say it's for RFL so I know to accept.

<h2>Goals for this organization</h2>
I hope for this to grow into a thriving REMATCH eSports community, allowing players to come together and compete, showing off their teamwork and solo skills. I wish for all REMATCH tournaments to partner up with us, or merge into us, so that there is a central place for official tournaments. As of right now, this will stay as an online tournament, however, if RFL grows and gains a following, we will attempt to start making a LAN tournament, such as VCT for Valorant.
