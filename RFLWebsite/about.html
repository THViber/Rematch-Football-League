            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>RFL, Rematch Football League, is a place to host and run REMATCH tournaments. Our mission is to provide a competitive and enjoyable platform for players of all skill levels to engage in REMATCH football.
                The League was founded by Vibe, a passionate REMATCH player who wanted to create a structured environment for tournaments and leagues. After competing in a couple tournaments,
                Vibe saw the need for a dedicated league to support the growing REMATCH community, as others were slowly crumbling apart. With this vision in mind, RFL was born.
